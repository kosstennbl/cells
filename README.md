Repo with code for testing different methods of measuring distance between organic cells on 3D and 2D images.
Results of these tests were used for Bachelor's thesis.

This code isn't meant to be perceived as a usable application, all configuration is done directly in the code, runs straight from interpreter.
Also, code quality is quite poor and there are multiple design flaws, but it will not be rewritten (no reason to do so).

Main result of this, "Cell Border Comparison" alorithm, was re-implemented in Java and introduced to FIJI by Vladimir Ulman (@xulman)
